                <p>Dear amazing Zoan family,</p>
                
                <p>→ To everyone celebrating today — <strong>Merry Christmas!</strong> 🎅✨<br>
                May your day be filled with warmth, laughter, good food, and maybe a few epic carries with friends.</p>
                
                <p>→ To those who don’t celebrate Christmas — happy holidays and season’s greetings! ❄️<br>
                No matter how you spend this time, we hope it’s full of peace, joy, and people (or pets) you love.</p>
                
                <p>→ A heartfelt <strong>thank you</strong> to every single one of you for being part of this server.<br>
                From the daily grinders to the late-night chatters, the carriers helping new players, and everyone in between — <strong>you</strong> are what makes Zoan feel like home. This year has been incredible because of <em>you</em>.</p>
                
                <p>→ The Winter Event is now over, but the memories (and all those snowflakes you earned!) will stay with us.<br>
                We’re taking a short break to recharge, but trust us — we’re already excited for what’s coming in 2026.</p>
                
                <p>Rest well, enjoy the holidays, and get ready… the adventure continues soon! 🏴‍☠️</p>
