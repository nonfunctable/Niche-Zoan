                <p>As the clock strikes midnight and the sky erupts in gold, we stand at the threshold of a brand new
                    year. <strong>2026</strong> isn't just another year on the calendar—it's a fresh canvas for the Zoan
                    community.</p>

                <p>Reflecting on the past twelve months, we are humbled by the growth, the challenges we've overcome
                    together, and the countless memories forged in our world. From the first raids to the late-night
                    strategy sessions, every moment has been a testament to your passion.</p>

                <p>This year, our resolution is simple: <strong>To push boundaries.</strong> We are working on
                    experiences that will redefine what it means to be part of Zoan. Expect deeper stories, sharper
                    challenges, and a world that feels more alive than ever before.</p>

                <p>Thank you for being the heart of this journey. May your 2026 be filled with legendary drops,
                    unbreakable alliances, and the kind of joy that only a true adventure can provide.</p>

                <p>Let's make history together.</p>

                <p class="sign-off">
                    Cheers to 2026,<br>
