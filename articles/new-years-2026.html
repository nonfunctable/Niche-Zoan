            <section class="message">
                <p>To our amazing community,</p>

                <p>→ As the fireworks light up the sky and we say goodbye to 2025 — <strong>Happy New Year!</strong>
                    ✨<br>
                    May 2026 bring you incredible luck, flawless defenses, and all the success you deserve.</p>

                <p>→ Looking back, 2025 was a year of massive change for us. There was a time during our <strong>merger
                        into Nexius</strong> where things felt uncertain, and many of us thought the server might have
                    reached its end. But because of your loyalty and the strength of this community, we didn't just stay
                    afloat — <strong>we came back stronger than ever.</strong></p>

                <p>→ Today, we are standing proud with <strong>over 1,000 members.</strong> Seeing this growth after
                    everything we've been through is truly humbling. Whether you're here to talk strategy for your
                    favorite tower defense games, share your newest units, or just hang out in the lounge —
                    <strong>you</strong> are what keeps the Zoan spirit alive.</p>

                <p>→ A massive <strong>thank you</strong> to every single one of you for choosing to be here. ❤️<br>
                    From the veteran players who stayed through the merger to the new faces who helped us cross that 1k
                    mark — we are so incredibly grateful for your passion, your memes, and your support.</p>

                <p>→ We're beyond excited for what's ahead in 2026. This next chapter is all about our community, and we
                    can't wait to see what heights we'll reach together. The adventure is only just beginning!</p>

                <p class="sign-off">
                    With all our love, gratitude, and hype for 2026,<br>
                    <strong>— The Zoan Team</strong> 🎆❤️<br>
                    <span style="font-size: 0.8em; opacity: 0.8;">Cheers to a legendary year ahead</span>
